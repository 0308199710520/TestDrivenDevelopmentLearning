## Starter

Facilitate a group discussion about what learners understands of a 
client, server, http and model, view, controller pattern

Demo the to do list application and draw a diagram of the 
sequence of events from the user typing in the url to 
the browser to items being displayed on the page. 

Demo dev tools in chrome and point out the network tab

Demo using `httpie` on the command line to make a request
and understand more about the response.

Show the code and label which part of the code is the model, 
controller and view in this case. 

## Main

Get into groups of 3 or 4 and ask to draw a diagram of each 
of the following scenarios

## Plenary

Some potential follow on questions:
What is the difference between get/post

What is the difference between how data is sent 
using a get or a post?

What does a redirect do? Why use one after a post?
