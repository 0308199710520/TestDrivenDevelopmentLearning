# Use Git to collaborate on code (and research the things you don't know how to do) (1 hour)

## The goal of the course

* Learn to learn.

## Learning objectives

1. Describe research as an important skill for a junior developer.
2. Explain how you go about researching a technical topic.
3. Collaborate on a Git repository, researching the things you don't know how to do.

## Collaborate on a Git repository; research the things you don't know how to do (30 mins)

1. Find your pair.  You'll work together.

2. You're going to collaborate on a document that lists your meals.  One of you is Alice. The other is Bob.

3. Alice. On your computer, create a directory called `meals`.

4. Alice. Inside the `meals` directory, create a file called `breakfast.txt`.

5. Alice. Write what you had for breakfast into `breakfast.txt`.  For example: `Alice had Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs`.

6. Alice. Commit your changes.

7. Alice. Create a repository on your GitHub account called `meals`.

8. Alice. Push your code to GitHub.

9. Alice. Add Bob as a collaborator on your `meals` GitHub repository.

10. Bob. **On your own computer**, clone Alice's `meals` repository.

11. Bob. Add what you had for breakfast to `breakfast.txt`.

12. Bob. Commit your change.

13. Bob. Push your changes to Alice's `meals` repository.

14. Alice. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

15. Bob. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

### Extra collaboration (optional)

1. Bob. Create a file called `lunch.txt` and add what you plan to have for lunch.

2. Bob. Commit your changes to a new `lunch` branch.

3. Bob. Push the `lunch` branch to Alice's `meals` repository.

4. Alice. Pull the `lunch` branch down to your machine.

5. Alice. Merge the `lunch` branch into the `master` branch.

6. Alice. Push the `master` branch to your `meals` GitHub repository.

## Plenary (15 mins)

We'll discuss the collaboration process, and the research process.
