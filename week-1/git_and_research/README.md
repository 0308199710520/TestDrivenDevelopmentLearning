# Use Git to collaborate on code (and research the things you don't know how to do) (1 hour)

## The goal of the course

* Learn to learn.

## Learning objectives

1. Describe research as an important skill for a junior developer.
2. Explain how you go about researching a technical topic.
3. Collaborate on a Git repository, researching the things you don't know how to do.

## Collaborate on a Git repository; research the things you don't know how to do (30 mins)

1. Find your pair.  You'll work together.

2. You're going to collaborate on a document that lists your meals.  One of you is Alice. The other is Bob.

3. Alice and Bob. Check that the email address in the global git config on your machine matches the email address associated with your GitHub account.  If it doesn't, update it.

4. Alice and Bob. Check that the name in the global git config on your machine is your name.  If it isn't, update it.

5. Alice. On your computer, create a directory called `meals`.

6. Alice. Inside the `meals` directory, create a file called `breakfast.txt`.

7. Alice. Write what you had for breakfast into `breakfast.txt`.  For example: `Alice had Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs`.

8. Alice. Commit your changes.

9. Alice. Create a repository on your GitHub account called `meals`.

10. Alice. Push your code to GitHub.

11. Alice. Add Bob as a collaborator on your `meals` GitHub repository.

12. Bob. **On your own computer**, clone (don't fork) Alice's `meals` repository.

13. Bob. Add what you had for breakfast to `breakfast.txt`.

14. Bob. Commit your change.

15. Bob. Push your changes to Alice's `meals` repository.

16. Alice. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

17. Bob. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

### Extra collaboration (optional)

1. Bob. Create a file called `lunch.txt` and add what you plan to have for lunch.

2. Bob. Commit your changes to a new `lunch` branch.

3. Bob. Push the `lunch` branch to Alice's `meals` repository.

4. Alice. Pull the `lunch` branch down to your machine.

5. Alice. Merge the `lunch` branch into the `master` branch.

6. Alice. Push the `master` branch to your `meals` GitHub repository.

## Plenary (15 mins)

We'll discuss the collaboration process, and the research process.
