# Use Git to collaborate on code (and research the things you don't know how to do) (1 hour)

## The goal of the course

* Learn to learn.

## Learning objectives

1. Describe research as an important skill for a junior developer.
2. Explain how you go about researching a technical topic.
3. Collaborate on a Git repository, researching the things you don't know how to do.

## Collaborate on a Git repository; research the things you don't know how to do (30 mins)

1. Find your pair.  You'll work together.

2. You're going to collaborate on a document that lists your meals.  One of you is Alice. The other is Bob.  It's Tuesday.

3. Alice and Bob. Check that the email address in the global git config on your machine matches the email address associated with your GitHub account.  If it doesn't, update it.

4. Alice and Bob. Check that the name in the global git config on your machine is your name.  If it isn't, update it.

5. Alice. On your computer, create a directory called `meals`.

6. Alice. Initialise `meals` as a git repo.

7. Alice. Inside the `meals` directory, create a file called `breakfast.txt`.

8. Alice. Write what you had for breakfast today into `breakfast.txt`.  For example: `On Tuesday, Alice had Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs`.

9. Alice. Commit your changes.

10. Alice. Create a repository on your GitHub account called `meals`.

11. Alice. Add your new GitHub repository as a remote on your local `meals` repository.

12. Alice. Push your code to GitHub (specifying that you want to push to the `origin` remove and the `master` branch).

13. Alice. Add Bob as a collaborator on your `meals` GitHub repository.

14. Bob. **On your own computer**, clone (don't fork) Alice's `meals` repository.

15. Bob. Add what you had for breakfast on Tuesday to `breakfast.txt`.

16. Bob. Commit your change.

17. Bob. Push your changes to Alice's `meals` repository.

18. Alice. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

19. Bob. Check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.

20. It's now Wednesday.  Bob is working with a new pair partner.  Bob and his new pair partner want to pick up where Bob and Alice left off on Tuesday.  To do this, Bob will create a new repo and point the remotes of the local repo he worked on with Alice at his new repo on GitHub.  When he pushes, his commits will go to the new repo.

21. Bob. Create a new `meals-2` repo on your GitHub account.

22. Bob. Remove the current `origin` remote from your local repo (the one you worked on with Alice).

23. Bob. Add a new `origin` remote to your local repo that points at your new `meals-2` repo.

24. Bob. Add what you plan to have for breakfast on Wednesday to `breakfast.txt`.

25. Bob. Commit your change.

26. Bob. Push from your local repo to the `master` branch on the `origin` remote (`meals-2`).

27. Bob. Check your new commit is listed in the contributions on your GitHub profile page.

28. (For Bob's pair partner to be able to contribute, Bob will need to add them as a collaborator on his `meals-2` repo.)

### Fun extra stuff if you finish

1. Create a branch.

2. Make a commit on the branch.

3. Push the branch to GitHub.

4. Merge the branch into `master` on your local machine.

5. Push the merged `master` to GitHub.

## Plenary (15 mins)

We'll discuss the collaboration process, and the research process.
