# Calculate!

## Learning Objectives:

- Define 'behaviour' as 'the things a program does'
- Define 'class' as a 'convenient encapsulation of behaviour'
- Encapsulate behaviour into classes

## Overview

* The coach will build a very simple calculator without using classes.
* You'll use classes to encapsulate the calculator code.

## Instructions

1. Clone the starter repository using `git clone <repo url>`.
1. Install any project dependencies using `bundle install`.

> You may have to run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler first.

1. Wrap common behaviour into a class structure. That is; encapsulate common functionality within classes.
