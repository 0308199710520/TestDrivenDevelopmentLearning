# Pair programming

From today onwards, you'll pair for some part of every day, whilst you're with us at Makers. This workshop is a short intro to the why and how of pair programming.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this workshop, all learners will be able to
- Recall at least two benefits of pair programming
- Explain two pairing styles
- Plan a pairing session
- Implement the driver/navigator style
- Reflect on a pairing session

## Why pair program?

We'll discuss this as a group and recap the main points during the plenary.

- two heads are better than one / fewer bugs
- learn from each other / see other ways of working
- practice handover to new pair
- practicing for the workplace
- division of responsibility / specialisation
- practice explaining the way you think / test your understanding
- practice interpersonal skills
- 

## Pair programming styles

Have a read about pairing styles [here](pairing_styles.md)

## Planning your pairing session

Use [this checklist](checklist.md)

## Now do some pairing!

Today you'll practice using the driver navigator style.  Make sure you plan your session, especially the timing of your cycles (i.e. when you will swap driver and navigator roles).

### The practicalities of remote pairing

- [] One person should create the remote repo and invite the other person as collaborator
- [] Both people should then clone the repo to their machines, as a new local repo
- [] Decide who is going to drive first
- [] The driver gets set up with their text editor and shares their screen
- [] You do some programming together and make regular commits
- [] When it's time to switch, you make sure everything is commited and push the changes
- [] The new driver pulls those changes to their machine and gets set up to screen share
- [] You do some more programming together and make regular commits...
