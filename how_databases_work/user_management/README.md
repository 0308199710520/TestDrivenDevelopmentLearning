# User Management

In this workshop, you'll learn about user management by reading through an unfamiliar codebase, where user management has been implemented.

## Why user management?
Pretty much every important thing you work on will have users who will need to sign up and sign in. They also need their credentials to be safely stored in your database, so that someone can't hack their account!

## Why the unfamiliar codebase?
It's likely that, in your career, you'll change teams quite a few times. Every time, you'll probably have to get to grips with a new codebase.

> This is actually going to happen sooner than you think because, during the bootcamp, you'll be given at least one unfamiliar codebase to extend, as part of a team.

So getting some practice with the task reading unfamiliar codebases is going to help you a lot, in the short term _and_ in the long term.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this workshop, all devs will be able to
1. Recognise the feeling of panic that sometimes comes from looking at new codebases
2. Follow an effective process for getting to grips with a new codebase

## Set up

1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/auth_workshop_codebase)
2. Follow the set up instructions in the `README` for that repo
3. Start the app and explore the user journeys for
    - Signing up
    - Signing in

## Exercise

For sign in and sign up...
1. Identify the relevant routes and methods – make a list of them.
2. Do a diagram that that shows how the items in your list interact.
3. Focusing only on the things in your list from step 1, read through the code to get a high level understanding of what's going on.
4. Make a list of questions based on the above.
5. Seek to answer those questions one by one.
6. Update your diagram with any new details you have.
7. Make a list of security features and potential vulnerabilities.
