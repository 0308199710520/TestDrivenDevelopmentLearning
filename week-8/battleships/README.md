# Battleships

This week, in the mornings, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time. For this one, there will be a light time pressure. See what you can get done in the mornings this week.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

Note: There are lots of stories. Focus on your software crafting process.
