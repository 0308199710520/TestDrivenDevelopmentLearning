# Following the flow in asynchronous JavaScript



## Instructions

- Clone this repository.

- Review the code in `index.js`, there are four commented out examples of asynchronous JavaScript.

- Uncomment each of the exercises in turn, you'll notice that the code includes a number of `console.log('')` lines.

- Populate these empty strings so that numbers are logged out to the console in the correct order `1, 2, 3...`.

- See the results of each exercise by opening the `index.html` file in Chrome, and viewing the console. You will need to click the page to see the complete output from Exercise 3!

- Once the numbers are being logged in the correct order for an exercise, take some time to make sure you can follow the flow of the code, before commenting out the solved exercise code and moving to the next one.
