## Error Handling

### Learning objectives
  * Understand that errors are part of the process of producing code
  * Understand how to extract relevant information from an error message
  * Use this information to solve errors in our code

### Introduction
  A big part of your job as a developer will involve encountering errors and bugs in yours (and other people's code). Our aim as a developer is not to produce perfect code upfront - even very experienced developers struggle to do that. Instead, developers learn how to interpret error messages as useful feedback and guidance for making a small next step.

### What kind of ways could code be broken?
   * Incorrect application of the language
   * Code doesn't fulfil criteria (broken tests)
   * Code doesn't pass standards

Try running the examples with
- `ruby example_1.rb`
- `ruby example_2.rb`
- `ruby example_3.rb`

Each of these has a different type of ruby error you might encounter.
What pieces of information do the error messages provide to us?

### Main

Have a go at running each of the code snippets within the `questions` directory e.g.
`ruby questions/question_1.rb`

Does the code run ok? If not can you find a syntax fix?

If the code is running ok, have a go at running the tests. This can be done with:
`rspec`

Does the code output what the test expects?
Does the code pass expected standards?
Have a go at updating the code in each question to pass the tests.

### Plenary

Have a discussion about how the students found the process of identifying and fixing errors. What thought approaches are helpful?
What makes the task challenging? What things can we do to make this easier?
