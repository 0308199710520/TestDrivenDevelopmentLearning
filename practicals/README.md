# Practical Workshops

Many of these use extended Markdown features, for instance diagrams, that won't appear on Github.

Paste them into a document on [HackMD](http://hackmd.io/) to use them.

## Feedback

Each of these sessions helps you train a skill.

**Consider how you will get feedback on whether you are applying the skill correctly.**

This might be asking a coach, another developer, or from some technical tool. It's important that it comes from somewhere, though.

You will know your feedback strategy isn't functioning adequately if you're worrying about things like "have I done this right?"

That's your brain giving you feedback that you're not getting enough feedback :)
