### Details

Rearrange your implementation to obey the following constraints

1. Each method can only have a maximum of 5 operations, where an operation is a variable assignment or a method call.
2. Each method can be a maximum of 5 lines (excluding method definition key words)
3. The only public method available should be Secret#encrypt (private methods are free to use).

Any amount of rearranging is fine, so long as the test cases still pass.
