## Cipher World - A beginning.

Your mission is to build a program that can encrypt and decrypt files with a chosen cipher.

Each part of this adventure has a set of Acceptance Criteria: these are mostly written as indicated method calls and their expected return values. Find part1, and start there. Grab the method calls and expectations, use a testing framework of your choice to speed your development, and start designing and test-driving.

If you're feeling like a real challenge, start with the Acceptance Criteria in the last part!
