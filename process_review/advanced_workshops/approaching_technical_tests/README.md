**Goal:** define a plan for approaching technical tests, and other larger technical challenges.

When approaching larger problems, having a plan can help to reduce stress and increase the chances of getting to a great solution.

We'll work through preparing to tackle a larger technical challenge together, and create a plan for approach any technical challenge.
