# Project: Process Recording

To achieve these goals:
  >"I can debug anything"
  >"I can program fluently"
  >"I can TDD anything"

## Action Plan
https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review#individual

Recording your own screen while you write some code is a useful tool to help you improve your development process.

To make it the most useful, follow these steps:
  - Reflect on your process - decide what part of your process you want to focus on.
  - Find a small exercise, or kata to practice it. (Start really small and simple and then extend from there) -Set a timer for 30 mins.
  - Record your screen
  - Program.
  - Review your recorded process, and use rubric to note down where to improve.
  - Repeat.

Feel free to reach out to a coach during coaching hours to sit with you and give you feedback. (They'll watch it 3x-5x times the speed)

# Observer
You are responsible for timing the session and recording feedback in 3 ways.
  - When the developer flails Record the timestamp of flails* - use your timer to note the time.
  - Is their process clear? Record if the developer indicates what stage of their process they're at throughout the session. Did it stop at some point- Did one stage last most of the session? Were there lots of stage jumps?
  - Record other feedback you notice
