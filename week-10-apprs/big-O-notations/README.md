# Big O Notations

----
### What do these notations mean?

Big O of `X` means:
The function describing the curve of the algorithm is "small" compared to `X`, where `X` is a function.

The functions commonly used to describe complexity are (in order of increasing complexity / descending efficiency ):

log(n) (logarithmic complexity)
n*log(n)  (nlogn complexity. Famous for being the minimal complexity for sorting algorithms)
n (linear complexity)
n^2 (quadratic complexity)
n^3 (cubic complexity)
2^n (exponential complexity)

Look at curves for each of them:

Let's learn to derive the "complexity" by looking at code.



Most algorithms will have a worst case scenario. This is the case we used when speaking about complexity.
The average scenario can also be talked about sometimes.

Chat about different algorithms covered this week, and their "big Os". Did you manage to get to the target "big O"?

Can you characterise these algorithms into *logarithmic*, *linear*, *quadratic*, *cubic* or *exponential* complexity?

Chat about optimisation.
End on the Learning objectives.
