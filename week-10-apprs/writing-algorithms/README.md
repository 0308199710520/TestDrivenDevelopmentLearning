# How to write algorithms, an intuitive approach

Algorithms are a sequence of instructions that solve a given problem.
But how do you come up with the instructions? In this workshop, we'll explore the process of writing algorithms.

## Learning objectives

*  Explain the process of creating algorithms
*  Use the process to create simple algorithms

## Creating Algorithms

### Proposed process

1. Describe the problem (sometimes a diagram helps)
2. Create test cases.
3. Think about how you would do this, given this task in real life.
4. Write down each step in plain english
5. If it is possible directly, translate each of the steps into code
6. Otherwise, think about each step separately, and repeat 3 to 6.
7. Once everything is translated to code, run your testcases
8. If tests fail, debug your code, following the state of variables line by line.

Bonus:

9. How fast is this? Run it through your timing framework.
10. Could it be simpler? faster? more readable? Refactor.

### Instructions

For each of the following problems, follow the process to come up with a solution.

#### Assigning Students into groups

Given a list of students, and a target number of groups, create an algorithm to assign students into the right number of groups, of equivalent sizes (groups cannot have more than one person difference).

#### Finding duplicates

Given a list of things (numbers or words), return all the elements that are duplicated in the list.
