# How to write algorithms, an intuitive approach

Algorithms are a sequence of instructions that solve a given problem.
But how do you come up with the instructions? In this workshop, we'll explore the process of writing algorithms.

## Learning objectives

*  Explain the process of creating algorithms
*  Use the process to create simple algorithms

## Creating Algorithms

### Proposed process

* Describe the problem (sometimes a diagram helps), and create test case.
* Think about how you would do this, given this task in real life.
* Write down each step in plain english
* If it is possible directly, translate the steps to code
* Otherwise, think about each step separately, and repeat that procedure
* Once everything is translated to code, run your testcases

### Instructions

For each of the following problems, follow the process to come up with a solution.

#### Finding duplicates

Given a list of things (numbers or words), find if there are any duplicates in the list.

#### Assigning Students into groups

Given a list of students, and a target number of groups, create an algorithm to assign students randomly into the right number of groups, of equivalent sizes (groups cannot have more than one person difference).
