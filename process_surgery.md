# Process surgery

Helps struggling students improve their developer processes.

Can be run once a week.

## Required materials

* A private room.

* A whiteboard.

* 45 minutes.

## Format

* Gather 2 - 7 struggling students in a room.

* Ask someone to describe a time they struggled when developing code.  This might be "I couldn't figure out a domain model" or "My pair partner kept grabbing the keyboard from me".  Encourage them to laser in on what the underlying problem was.

* Write a brief summary of the struggle on the whiteboard.

* Suggest an improvement to their process that might help with the struggle.

* Write the process improvement near the struggle.

* Repeat.

* At the end, circulate a photo of the whiteboard to the attending students.

## Example Slack announcement

@channel: I’ll run a process surgery on [date and time] in [location].

If you feel you’ve been struggling at Makers, do come along.  We’ll share things we’ve struggled with when developing code, and talk about possible process improvements we could make to avoid those struggles in the future.  Please prepare a short description of something you struggled with this week so that we can make the most of the time.

I expect fewer than 10 people to come to the surgery.  We can all always improve our processes, but if you feel like you’re basically doing OK, please don’t come.
