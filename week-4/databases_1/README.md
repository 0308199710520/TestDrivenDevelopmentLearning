# Diagramming database structure (40 minutes)

## Learning objectives

1. Infer a domain from some code.
2. Infer the structure of a database from a domain.
3. Diagram the structure of a database.

createdb databases_1
createdb databases_1_test
```

## Running the code

```
cd path/to/databases_1/
ruby run.rb
```
